# Contributing to four-opencode-git-tools

## Workflow

Every change follows: **Issue → Branch → Commit → PR → Review → Merge → Cleanup**

1. **Create an issue** — describe the bug, feature, or refactor
2. **Branch** — `feat/<issue>-short-desc` | `fix/<issue>-short-desc` | `refactor/<issue>-short-desc`
3. **Implement** — follow conventions in GUIDELINES.md
4. **Commit** — conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`
5. **PR** — fill template, reference issue with `Closes #N`
6. **Review** — architect reviews, CI passes
7. **Merge** — squash merge, delete branch
8. **Cleanup** — `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only && git branch -D <branch>`

## Conventions

### Code
- **Source file:** `src/four-opencode-git-tools.ts` (not `src/index.ts`)
- **npm name:** `@four-bytes/four-opencode-git-tools`
- **Language:** TypeScript, strict mode, ESM
- **Target:** Bun
- **Format:** Prettier (single quotes, 100 width, 2 tab, semicolons)

### Commits
```
feat: short description #42
fix: short description #42
docs: short description #50
```

Always reference the issue number.

### Build
```bash
bun run build      # Bun.build to dist/
bun test           # bun test
bun run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
```

Every code change must end with a successful build. Dist is gitignored.

## Architecture

Plugin registers token-efficient git analysis tools for opencode agents:
- **curse_score** — Identify most-changed / most-buggy files via commit history
- **bus_factor** — Measure knowledge concentration per module
- **implicit_coupling** — Detect files that change together frequently
- **ownership** — Map file ownership to authors
- **blast_radius** — Estimate impact of a change set

See `ROADMAP.md` for the evolution plan.
